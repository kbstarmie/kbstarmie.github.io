<a href="/2017/03/12/fold-in-powershell.html"><h1>Fold in PowerShell</h1></a>
<h4>12 Mar 2017</h4>
<p>Oftentimes, when working with data, you might find yourself needing to process or transform it in some way to continue. Duh, no kidding, you might say. Are you really writing a blog post about this? Run with me here, I promise there’s gold at the end of the rainbow.</p>

<p>Anyway. You might say “Sure, I’ll use Excel and apply a function to my dataset”. To which I’ll reply “Good luck applying a regular expression to a range”, or, “Good luck reading a nested conditional”, and walk away.</p>

<p>My tool of choice for doing any sort of data munging is PowerShell. The above problem is as simple as follows:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$list | % { $_ -match "(.*)" ; $matches[1] }
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Naturally, you can make that script block do whatever task you want, including be readable. PowerShell 1, Excel 0.</p>

<p>By the way, that little <em>%</em> symbol is actually an alias for <em>Foreach-Object</em>, a cute function/cmdlet that applies your block to every item in your list. Very neat!</p>

<p>Some of you might point out “hey, that’s a map!”. And you would be completely spot on. Although it doesn’t admit it, PowerShell actually has a lot of functional structures that you can take advantage of. Map and filter are practically first-class citizens, with dedicated functions and aliases to perform these operations over lists.</p>

<p>One of the key advantages of functional programming, I find, is the provision of many standard utility functions, with well-understood behaviours, to save you on reimplementing these basic tasks over and over. That and partial application. And a usable type system. Sadly, we don’t get those last two with PowerShell, but we’re in a command shell, not writing F# or Haskell.</p>

<p>So instead of writing this code twenty times a day…</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$results = @()
foreach ($item in $list) {
  if ($item.property -eq $desiredValue) {
    $results += $item
  }
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can write this!</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$list | ? { $_.property -eq $desiredValue }
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Or this!</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$list | ? -Property property -eq -Value $desiredValue
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The <em>?</em> symbol is the alias for <em>Where-Object</em>, which is clearly the filter function.</p>

<p>However, one very notable omission is the fold.</p>

<p>Where map is used for applying some function to every item in a list, and filter is used to select every item in a list according to some function, fold basically collapses every item in a list into a single value, according to some function.</p>

<p>Having found it useful in my day to day activities, I have these neat functions lying around.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>function foldl {
    param(
        $baseValue, $f, $list
    )

    if ($list.length -gt 1) {
        foldl $(&amp; $f $baseValue $list[0]) $f $list[1..$($list.length)]
    } else {
        &amp; $f $baseValue $list[0]
    }
}

function foldr {
    param($baseValue, $f, $list)

    if ($list.length -gt 0) {
        &amp; $f $list[0] (foldr -f $f -baseValue $baseValue -list $list[1..($list.length)])
    } else {
        $baseValue
    }
}

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>“What the heck did I just read?!”, you may ask. Let’s break it down a bit.</p>

<p><em>fold</em> starts off with a base value, and applys its function to every item in the list, “adding” the result to its base value and continuing. The fold-left version works slightly differently to the fold-right version - left will apply the function to the left-most values first, and the right version will apply it from the right. The difference is completely non-existent in PowerShell, so best not to worry about it.</p>

<p>So what do you even use this for? Here’s a simple example that sums a list.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>PS /home/kbstarmie&gt; foldl -baseValue 0 -f {param($1,$2) $1 + $2} -list @(1..100)
5050
PS /home/kbstarmie&gt; foldr -baseValue 0 -f {param($1,$2) $1 + $2} -list @(1..100)
5050

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You’re basically limited by your imagination (and requirements) in folding things. You can use it to check if the property of every object is true, like so.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>foldl -baseValue $true -f {param($1,$2) $1.property -and $2.property} -list $someObjectList
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Obviously, you will need to ensure your objects have the right properties so the system doesn’t complain, but it’s a small price to pay for the convenience of a useful PowerShell helper function!</p>

<p>I appreciate that some of this content might go right over some readers who haven’t been acquainted with functional programming fundamentals. In that case, I wholeheartedly recommend spending an afternoon or evening with <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn You A Haskell For Great Good!</a> to be introduced to the basics. It’s fun, trust me.</p>

<p>Anyway, I just wanted to introduce this small function and I hope that you all find it useful in your day to day data munging, scripting, or whatever! I’ve made a script <a href="https://github.com/kbstarmie/powershell-snippets/blob/master/functions/fold.ps1">available in my PowerShell repository</a> if you’re rushing to apply it to your profile loaded code.</p>

<p>Until next time <em>~Kira</em></p>
