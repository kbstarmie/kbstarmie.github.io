Oh, hello there. If you've somehow stumbled here through the magic of hypertext, I'd like to welcome you to my humble technical blog.

My aim here is to post snippets, code, commentary, and to showcase some of my day to day work as an IT professional in a medium sized company.

Right now, the focus will be on Powershell based administration of Windows machines, with some Systems Center operations and administration. I hope that the content I post here will be of some use to you who wander here.

Until next time!
